# Local Talent Matcher Frontend

## Link to the Backend GitHub Repository: https://github.com/MelkWold/localTalentBackEnd

## Project Description and Features
Local Talent Matcher is a full stack website that matches local professionals and service providers (E.g. tutors, electricians, accountants, plumbers, software engineers, web developers etc) with local clients (individuals, small businesses, mom-and-pop businesses, etc). Customers will be able to search for talented individuals based on services, hire them for a task and pay them using standard payment processing methods. After the completion of the task, both providers and customers will be able to rate each other and write reviews about their experiences.

## Pages included:
The following starter pages are included in the project. Please note that more work is planned to make the pages more functional, capabale and integrated. 
- Home - a functional page with dynamic interactivity
- Dashboard- a functional page that displays the basic information of the provider/customer with their respective reviews. It also allows authenticated users to edit  or delete their profiles. 
- Profile- a functional page that displays the reviews that the provider/customer received. Planned to be made a public page (not a protected page) later. 
- Tasks: a functional page that displays the list of tasks that providers had or currently have with the relevant details. More work is planned to make this fully functional including the ability to edit the status of the work, ability to leave comments etc. For customers, the tasks page displays services that they received or are in the process of receiving. 
- Messages - a placeholder for a messaging functionality; more work needs to be done later. 
- Search: a placeholder (not integrated into the frontend) to allow customers search for providers using multiple filters.
